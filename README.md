# distributed-sys-6.824
A distributed systems build from scratch with MIT 6.824 course



#### what is 6.824 about?

6.824 is a core 12-unit graduate subject with lectures, readings, programming labs, an optional project, a mid-term exam, and a final exam. It will present abstractions and implementation techniques for engineering distributed systems. Major topics include fault tolerance, replication, and consistency. Much of the class consists of studying and discussing case studies of distributed systems.

### about me

I am gonna follow this course to learn the distributed system and translate the course to chinese.

I find that some super nice people have just finished the translation of mit course. So I decided to end the translation and focus on the code.
